2. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?

SELECT * FROM reviews
JOIN businesses
JOIN users
WHERE reviews.business_id = businesses.id AND reviews.user_id = users.id;
=>
1|4|Great view|1|1|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|1|Bradford|Pitt
2|5|Quick service|2|1|2|Amir's Towing|1|Bradford|Pitt
3|1|Horrible staff|1|3|1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Angela|Jolie


3. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.

SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.lastname
FROM reviews
JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id=businesses.id
JOIN users ON reviews.user_id=users.id;
=>
4|Great view|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Pitt
5|Quick service|Amir's Towing|Pitt
1|Horrible staff|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Jolie


4. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?

SELECT reviews.stars, reviews.comment, businesses.name, users.lastname
FROM reviews
JOIN businesses ON reviews.business_id = businesses.id
JOIN users ON reviews.user_id = users.id
WHERE businesses.name = "Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel";
=>
4|Great view|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Pitt
1|Horrible staff|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|Jolie
