9.3 jQuery
Release 0: Make a Plan

 Spend 10 minutes making a plan for how you intend to tackle jQuery and learn as much as you can in two hours. What sorts of resources will help? How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important? Make a few notes in the file on how you plan to approach the topic, and why.

# Resources

# Testing
I will aim to test after every new block of code is added or small discrete functional change in returns or outputs, in order to build features one statement at a time. 

# Breaks
2hrs seems like a feasible time to be the duration between breaks - plus its the given articulation of the assignment - so after Release 1 (2hrs) seems like a good time to take a 5-15min break then return to finish Release 2 (45min). Typically, if there is spare time after all the week's coursework is finished, the assignments' subjects will be revisited to learn more and/or add to the submitted work.

# Approach
- Study
 - Read some introductory materials to get a gist enough to develop questions
  - Take notes on key practical concepts, syntax, etc.
  - Question: explicate a question with a discrete answer
  - Answer: search for answer in resources
  - Imagine: keep an open mind for feature ideas to percolate
     & speculate what can be built with already possessed tools/skills
    - Note build-able features with concern separation / functional decomp
- Make
 - Ideate Feature: start with imitating example features
    & with every successful practice exercise increase degree of exploration
  - Init
   - Pseudo
   - Code
   - Run
   - Debug
   - Commit
  - Repeat.
