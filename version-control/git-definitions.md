# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control is a concept used by computer systems like git & GitHub to manage the history of a repo(sitory) (directories & files), which helps automate the tracking of differences between changes made by users. Version control is useful because versions of the one or many repos can be worked on by one or many users simultaneously, their changes documented, & their mistakes reverted from - ultimately version control is valuable because (by analogy with biology) divergent & convergent lines of change promote diversification & evolutionary progress.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
In version control systems like git/GitHub, a branch is the line of change belonging to an auxiliary version from the master version of a repo. A branch is useful for making changes to a repo be making another version to avoid risking the source version, like using a working copy to protect its model.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
In version control systems like git/GitHub, a commit is an action taken to 'save' new changes made within the same repo - either master or branch. A good commit message should use the present tense to describe what changes were made that the user wants to include in the repo, it is comment-like text included with the commit command that says what the commit will do to the repository.

* What is a merge conflict?
In  version control systems like git/GitHub, a merge conflict is an error that happens when a user is trying to merge their changed branch version repo into its master version repo but it fails because some changes made to the master since the branch was made disagree with the changes made on that branch.
