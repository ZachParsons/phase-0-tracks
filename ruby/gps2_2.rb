# Release 0: Pseudocode

# Method to create a list
# input: string of items separated by spaces (example: "carrots apples cereal pizza")
# steps: 
  # create empty hash
  # get string
  # split string into items
  # add each item to the hash as a key
  # set default quantity = 1
  # call print method
# output: grocery list hash

# Method to add an item to a list
# input: list, item name, and optional quantity
# steps:
  #  add item as key
  #  add item's quantity as value
  #  call print method
# output: grocery list hash

# Method to remove an item from the list
# input: grocery hash list, item to remove, quantity to subtract
# steps:
  # subtract item quantity or delete item
  # call print method
# output: grocery list hash

# Method to update the quantity of an item
# input: list, item, updated quantity
# steps:
  # change a grocery hash key value
  # call print method
# output:

# Method to print a list and make it look pretty
# input: grocery list hash
# steps:
  # format the hash
  # iteration
# output: print the formatted list

# Release 4: Reflect
# # What did you learn about pseudocode from working on this challenge?
# I practiced functional decompoistion of a program into separate dedicate behaviors by making multiple methods for creating, adding, removing, updating, printing a hash.

# # What are the tradeoffs of using arrays and hashes for this challenge?
# The tradeoff of using a hash is the ability to store items names as keys & their quantities as values, whereas arrays would be better suited for a ranked/prioritized list.

# # What does a method return?
# A method returns what its body evaluates to, which somtimes involves external arguments passed to internal paramters. 

# # What kind of things can you pass into methods as arguments?
# Arguments passed into method parameters can be any data type & comparatively small variables or large data structures.

# # How can you pass information between methods?
# Passing information between methods can be done by creating variables to compare with multiple method returns (like in our test boolean),
# also data structures with global scope allowing access by multiple methods allow their interaction.

# # What concepts were solidified in this challenge, and what concepts are still confusing?
# Concepts we solidified in this challenge was primarily using methods to manipulate hashes & testing their returns,
# & secondarily we practiced writing/translating pseudocode, defining/comparing/passing data between methods, the distinction between return & print, & implementing documentation provided built-in methods.
